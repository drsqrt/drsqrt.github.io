            <h3>
                Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990)[1][2] is a Norwegian chess grandmaster who is the reigning five-time World Chess Champion. He is also a three-time World Rapid Chess Champion and five-time World Blitz Chess Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess.

                <br>

                Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019. He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, against Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and against Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen does not intend to defend his title against Nepomniachtchi in 2023.

                Fabiano Luigi Caruana (born July 30, 1992) is an Italian-American chess player. A chess prodigy, Caruana became a grandmaster at the age of 14 years, 11 months, and 20 days—the youngest grandmaster in the history of both Italy and the United States at the time.
                <br>

                Having won the FIDE Grand Prix 2014–15, Caruana qualified for the Candidates Tournament 2016, where he was runner-up to Sergey Karjakin. He won the 2016 US Chess Championship, and represented the United States on board one at the 42nd Chess Olympiad, winning team gold and individual bronze. He won the London Chess Classic in 2017. Caruana won the Candidates Tournament 2018, becoming the first American challenger for the undisputed World Chess Championship since Bobby Fischer in 1972. In the run-up to the championship match, he won the 5th Grenke Chess Classic, the 6th Norway Chess, and shared first in the 6th Sinquefield Cup. Caruana lost the match to Magnus Carlsen in the rapid tiebreaks after drawing all twelve of the classical games.

            <h3> 
                Viswanathan "Vishy" Anand (born 11 December 1969) is an Indian chess grandmaster and a five-time world chess champion.[2] He became the first grandmaster from India in 1988, and is one of the few players to have surpassed an Elo rating of 2800, a feat he first achieved in 2006.[3] In 2022, he was elected the deputy president of FIDE.
                <br>
                Anand defeated Alexei Shirov in a six-game match to win the 2000 FIDE World Chess Championship, a title he held until 2002. He became the undisputed world champion in 2007, and defended his title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2008, Veselin Topalov in 2010, and Boris Gelfand in 2012.[6] In 2013, he lost the title to challenger Magnus Carlsen, and he lost a rematch to Carlsen in 2014 after winning the 2014 Candidates Tournament.[7]

                In April 2006, Anand became the fourth player in history to pass the 2800 Elo mark on the FIDE rating list, after Kramnik, Topalov, and Garry Kasparov.[8] He occupied the number one position for 21 months, the sixth-longest period on record.

                Known for his rapid playing speed as a child, Anand earned the sobriquet "Lightning Kid"[9][10] during his early career in the 1980s. He has since developed into a universal player, and many consider him the greatest rapid chess player of his generation.[11][12] He won the FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship in 2003 and 2017,[13] the World Blitz Cup in 2000,[14] and numerous other top-level rapid and blitz events.

                Anand was the first recipient of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 1991–92, India's highest sporting honour. In 2007, he was awarded India's second-highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, making him the first sportsperson to receive the award.

                Ian Alexandrovich Nepomniachtchi (Russian: Ян Алекса́ндрович Непо́мнящий, tr. Yan Aleksandrovich Nepomnyashchiy, IPA: [ˈjan ɐlʲɪkˈsandrəvʲɪtɕ nʲɪˈpomnʲɪɕːɪj] (listen); born 14 July 1990) is a Russian chess grandmaster.

                Nepomniachtchi won the 2010 and 2020 Russian Superfinal and the 2010 European Individual titles. He also won the 2016 Tal Memorial and both the 2008 and 2015 Aeroflot Open events. He won the World Team Chess Championship as a member of the Russian team in Antalya[1] (2013) and Astana (2019). Nepomniachtchi won the 2015 European Team Chess Championship in Reykjavík with the Russian team.
                <br>
                In October 2016, Nepomniachtchi was ranked fourth in the world in both rapid chess and blitz chess. He has won two silver medals in the World Rapid Championship and a silver medal at the World Blitz Championship as well as winning the 2008 Ordix Open. In December 2019, he qualified for the Candidates Tournament 2020–2021 by finishing second in the FIDE Grand Prix 2019. He won the 2021 FIDE Candidates tournament with a round to spare, which qualified him as the challenger in the World Chess Championship 2021 for the world championship title but lost his challenge to defending champion Magnus Carlsen. In July 2022, he won the 2022 FIDE Candidates tournament with a round to spare, thereby winning two Candidates tournaments in a row and again qualifying him to play in the World Chess Championship 2023; additionally, he garnered the highest score in any Candidates tournament since the modern format was introduced in 2013.

                Hikaru Nakamura (born December 9, 1987) is a Japanese-American chess grandmaster and Twitch streamer. A chess prodigy, at the age of 15 he became the youngest American up to that time (2003) to earn the title of Grandmaster. Nakamura is a five-time U.S. Chess Champion.[2] He won the 2011 edition of Tata Steel Chess Tournament Group A and represented the United States at five Chess Olympiads, winning a team gold medal and two team bronze medals.
                <br>
                His peak USCF rating was 2900, achieved in August 2015.[3] In October 2015, he reached his peak FIDE rating of 2816, which ranked him second in the world, behind Magnus Carlsen. In May 2014, when FIDE began publishing official rapid and blitz chess ratings, Nakamura ranked number one in the world on both lists; he has remained at or around the top spot on both lists ever since.[4][5] As of December 2021, he has won all of the last four Chess.com Speed Chess Championships.

            <h3>
                Vidit Santosh Gujrathi (born 24 October 1994) is an Indian chess player. He attained the title of Grandmaster in January 2013, becoming the 30th player from India to do so. As of August 2022, he is the fifth highest rated player in India (behind Viswanathan Anand, Gukesh D, Arjun Erigaisi and Pentala Harikrishna). He is the fourth Indian player to have crossed the Elo rating threshold of 2700.
                <br>
                Vidit has played in qualifying events for the world championship since 2015, although that year he did not advance out of the first round at the Chess World Cup. In 2017, he forced a third-round playoff against GM and now longtime world number-three Ding Liren. In 2019, in addition to again reaching the third round of the World Cup, Vidit finished 12th at the Isle of Man Grand Swiss in a field of 154. 

                Vidit should have many more chances to qualify for the Candidates in the 2020s, as his rating reached a new high of 2726 in March 2020, placing him in the top 25 worldwide.
