    <h1>Chirping of the Birds</h1>
    
    <article>
      <h3>2nd July 2021</h3>
      <p>Today in the morning, I woke up to the chirping of the birds. I am nostalgic about my childhood vacations when I used to wake up to the chirping of sparrows only. It's a great happiness in its own, and I feel blessed about it.</p>
      
      <p>Some days back, I was mentioning the chirping of the birds and somehow, I feel like the chirping of the birds is a pleasant phenomenon. I feel like chirping is a low-vibration phenomenon. I talked about the vibration concept some days back, where I mentioned that all the phenomena happening in this world are in vibration mode.</p>

      <p>What do you mean by that?</p>
      <p>Like this wall here, like this laptop, and that sound of the bike, everything is related to the vibration of sound and particles. So, at any stage, particles in the surroundings are vibrating at different paces and frequencies. And when there is some motion or disturbance in the vibration, we feel a difference. When we speak, vibrations are produced, and when this wall is at rest, all the particles of this wall are vibrating. It's just that our eyes can't see it.</p>
      <p>Even my body is vibrating at its own frequency, and every cell of this body is vibrating at some frequency. It's a beautiful phenomenon happening every day. I feel like this is the way how we feel good about someone when we see them and for some, we don't.</p>
      <p>In the case of the chirping of the birds, I feel like they have that sweet frequency where they are vibrating, and it feels good to our ears. This is the single reason I feel like birds should be everywhere near us.</p>
      <p>Writing this on laptop, and especially in this application(Obsidian), I feel good about it. I feel like this is such a good way to write and express myself better. The offline world has its own beauty, and this is an offline tool. I am blessed.</p>
